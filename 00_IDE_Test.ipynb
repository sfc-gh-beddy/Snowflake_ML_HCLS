    "- All cells should execute without errors\n",
    "- Package imports should succeed\n",
    "- Environment should be detected correctly\n",
    "- Connection helper should import successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "### \ud83d\udd27 If You See Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kernel Issues:**\n",
    "- Make sure you selected the `snowflake-ml-platform` kernel\n",
    "- Try running: `chmod +x setup_ide.sh && ./setup_ide.sh`\n",
    "- Restart your IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Package Import Errors:**\n",
    "- Run: `conda activate snowflake-ml-platform && pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "- Check that you're in the right environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection Issues:**\n",
    "- Create `.env` file: `cp env_template.txt .env`\n",
    "- Edit `.env` with your Snowflake credentials\n",
    "- Run full connection test: `python connection_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### \ud83d\ude80 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything looks good:\n",
    "1. **Start with the demo**: Open `13_ML_Platform_Demo.ipynb`\n",
    "2. **Or begin systematically**: Start with `01_Environment_Setup.ipynb`\n",
    "3. **IDE advantage**: You can now debug, set breakpoints, and use all IDE features!\n",
    "\n",
    "### \ud83d\udca1 IDE Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**: Use your IDE's variable inspector to see Snowpark DataFrames\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Set breakpoints in notebook cells\n",
    "- **Code Completion**: Get IntelliSense for Snowflake functions\n",
    "- **Git Integration**: Track changes to notebooks with built-in Git\n",
    "- **Split View**: Open multiple notebooks side by side\n",
