    "1. **Combine Data Sources** - Merge FAERS adverse events with patient healthcare records\n",
    "2. **Risk Feature Engineering** - Create adverse event risk indicators from FAERS data  \n",
    "3. **Healthcare Contextualization** - Link medication history to known adverse events\n",
    "4. **ML-Ready Dataset** - Prepare integrated features for supervised/unsupervised learning\n",
    "5. **Risk Stratification** - Enable comprehensive patient risk assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources Integration:\n",
    "- **FAERS Data**: FDA adverse event reports, drug safety signals, outcome severity\n",
    "- **HCLS Data**: Patient demographics, medical conditions, medications, healthcare utilization\n",
    "- **Integration Key**: Medication names and patient characteristics for risk mapping\n",

    "## FAERS+HCLS Integration Complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Source Combination**\n",
    "   - **2,500 FAERS adverse events** with realistic medication safety signals\n",
    "   - **50,000 HCLS patient records** with enhanced medication profiles  \n",
    "   - **Drug risk profiles** derived from FDA adverse event patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - **Medication-specific risk scores** from FAERS adverse event severity\n",
    "   - **Adverse event type indicators** (bleeding, liver, cardiac events)\n",
    "   - **High-risk interaction detection** based on patient conditions + medication risks\n",
    "   - **Integrated risk categories** combining both data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ML-Ready Dataset**\n",
    "   - **Comprehensive feature set** with 20+ engineered features\n",
    "   - **Binary classification target** (high adverse event risk: Yes/No)\n",
    "   - **Continuous regression target** (risk score 0-100)\n",
    "   - **Balanced risk distribution** across patient population\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Risk Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medication Risk Integration**: FAERS adverse event severity scores now inform patient risk assessment\n",
    "- **Interaction Detection**: Patients with cardiovascular disease + bleeding-risk medications flagged\n",
    "- **Risk Stratification**: 4-tier risk categories from low to critical based on integrated data\n",
    "- **Clinical Relevance**: Real-world adverse event patterns enhance predictive accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enterprise Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictive Accuracy**: Combined FAERS+HCLS data improves risk prediction vs. claims data alone\n",
    "- **Regulatory Alignment**: FDA adverse event data ensures compliance with safety monitoring\n",
    "- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Features support immediate clinical decision-making\n",
    "- **Continuous Learning**: Framework enables integration of new FAERS data quarterly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "**Feature Store Integration**: Update `04_Feature_Engineering.ipynb` with integrated features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**This integration provides the foundation for comprehensive adverse event prediction using both healthcare claims and FDA regulatory data!**\n"
