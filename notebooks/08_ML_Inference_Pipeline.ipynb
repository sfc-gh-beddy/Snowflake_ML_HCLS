    "## **Objectives:**\n",
    "1. **Deploy Models** - Convert trained models to inference services\n",
    "2. **Real-time Scoring** - Single patient risk prediction endpoints\n",
    "3. **Batch Inference** - Large-scale patient cohort processing\n",
    "4. **Service Monitoring** - Performance and usage tracking\n",
    "5. **API Integration** - REST endpoints for external systems\n",

    "## **What We'll Create:**\n",
    "- **Inference Services** from trained XGBoost and other models\n",
    "- **Real-time Endpoints** for individual patient scoring\n",
    "- **Batch Processing** pipelines for cohort analysis\n",
    "- **Monitoring Tables** for service performance tracking\n",
